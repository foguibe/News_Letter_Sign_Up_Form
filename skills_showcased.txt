Hey there! In my project, I've demonstrated a variety of skills:

1. Structured HTML with Semantic Tags: I took care to organize the HTML structure using tags like `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and others.
This not only enhances the document's structure but also makes it more understandable.

2. Responsive Design with CSS Media Queries: I applied my CSS skills to create a visually appealing design. The use of flexbox, proper spacing, color schemes, 
and consistent typography ensures a seamless user experience across various devices. Responsive design, achieved through media queries, was a key aspect of my approach.

3. Interactive Form Handling with JavaScript: I added a layer of interactivity to the project using JavaScript. The validation of user input for the email subscription form 
and the immediate feedback provided contribute to a user-friendly experience. I also utilized local storage to store and retrieve the user's email for a personalized touch.

4. Accessibility Skills: I made sure to consider accessibility by including the `keydown` function in my JavaScript code. This allows users to submit the form not only by 
clicking but also by using the keyboard, making the form more accessible to a wider audience.

5. Version Control and Collaboration with GitHub: I showcased my proficiency in version control and collaboration tools by including GitHub links for Frontend Mentor and my project's
repository on my GitHub profile (`https://github.com/foguibe`).

6. Third-Party Integration (Google Fonts): I demonstrated my ability to leverage external resources effectively by integrating Google Fonts to enhance the project's typography.

7. User Flow and Experience: The redirection to a thank-you page upon successful subscription is a thoughtful addition. It not only confirms the user's action but also provides
a personalized touch by displaying their email on the thank-you page.

8. Documentation and Comments: I made sure to comment my code effectively, showcasing my commitment to clarity and readability. This is not only for my understanding but also 
for collaboration and future reference.

9. Cross-Browser Compatibility: I ensured a consistent experience across different web browsers by adhering to standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features.

In summary, this project is a reflection of my skills in HTML structure, CSS styling, responsiveness, JavaScript interactivity, local storage usage, version control, 
third-party integration, thoughtful user experience, documentation, accessibility, and more. I'm proud of how it all came together!
